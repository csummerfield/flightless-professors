                        <p><strong>September 2019</strong></p>

                        <p>Having decided not to fly, I need a plan.. Clearly, travel by train is going to form a big part of it. I provide more detail about resources that informed my planning in the <a href="methods.html">methods</a> section.</p>

                        <p>First I looked through my diary stretching into 2020. I cancelled a pending trips to the USA (sorry!). Future trips to conferences/workshops in Magdeburg and Salzburg looked feasible. Did you know that you can travel from London to Vienna by train in a day – about 12 travel time total? A forthcoming trip to <a href="https://www.marseille-tourisme.com/">Marseille</a> was feasible by train – about 7h from London.</p>

                        <img src="results-image.jpeg" alt="Train in Austria" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

                        <p>Austria by sleeper train! looks fun… </p>

                        <p>I realised that I was going to have to change the way I worked. Fewer but longer trips. Making sure I had the resources to work on the train. Travel for maximum impact: talks before large conference audiences might be worth it, but travelling to give a seminar to a small university department mostly wouldn’t be, unless the destination was easy to reach overland. So I also cancelled a future research visit to Hamburg (sorry!). Vivas could be conducted by videoconference. If the university regulations forbid that – well, sorry, find someone else. Or change the rules.</p>

                        <p>Straight away I received two new invitations: to give a research seminar in Germany, and a conference talk in Beijing. Both declined…sorry. In both cases, and in the case of the cancelled US talk, I offered to give the talk by videoconference. This was declined – in one case without explanation, in the other because of lack of facilities. Hmm…seems like there’s something that could be done about that.</p>

                        <p>I’ve always wanted to go to the machine learning conference ICLR. This coming year it’s in <a href="https://iclr.cc/">Addis Ababa</a>. Hmm, just for fun: is that even possible overland? Apparently, yes. Train to Marseille. <a href="https://www.cargoshipvoyages.com/">Freighter</a> to Alexandria. <a href="https://www.seat61.com/egypt.htm">Nile steamer + train</a> to Khartoum. Then a <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/ethiopia/addis-ababa">very long bus ride</a> to Addis Ababa. Total travel time: definitely not less than a month and probably ~6 weeks depending on the schedules. And that’s just one way! Perhaps I’ll wait til it’s back in Europe… </p>
